# MythsAndSteel
This is the official GitHub for MythsAndSteel. This git contains all the scripts and assets of MythsAndSteel. We create this project in Unity (version 2020.3.01f1)

# Acces to the project
Everyone on the internet can access this project. But this project is the property of RUBIKA (https://rubika-edu.com/). Everyone can download this project. But you don't have the authorization to publish this project or some parts of this project (with commercial purpose or not). 

# Who works on this project
It's all the first year students  (Game Artist and Game Design) at Rubika who work on the project. We are around 50 people who try to coordinate to create a project that we all like. We are not professional but we work really hard to be as close as professional will work. 

# Can I help you with some assets or by upgrading some of your script?
Because it's a student project we can't add parts of work of people around the world. It would be a real pleasure to work with you but we can't

# Where can I find the build of the game?
This project is actually in progress. There is no public build actually. Maybe in the future we will share a build of the project with you.
